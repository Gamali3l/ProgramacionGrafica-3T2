# 🦁 Zoo

Welcome to the **Zoo** project!

This interactive application, developed using **OpenGL** and **C++**, offers an immersive experience in a 3D environment simulating a real zoo, populated with 3D-modeled animals and enhanced with characteristic sounds.

## 🎮 About the Project

![Zoo environment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f9d239d-1fc3-4744-8ea0-4effa48dfde0)

The **Zoo** app is designed to demonstrate what has been learned in the **Computer Graphics** course, integrating key concepts such as 3D model importation, first-person camera control, custom shaders, and matrix transformations.

By exploring the zoo and approaching animals, users will hear their distinctive sounds, creating a sensory-rich experience.

### 🔍 Key Features

- 🌐 Fully navigable 3D environment
- 🎧 Proximity-activated animal sounds
- 🦍 Realistic and stylized models imported from Sketchfab
- 👨‍💻 Free camera controls (WASD + mouse)
- 🖼️ Basic UI for contextual information

## 🚀 Getting Started

> ❗ This project only runs correctly on **Visual Studio 2022 x64**

### ▶️ Run the App

1. **Download the project .Zip and files**  
   Download all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.frag`, and `.vert` files and extract to your chosen location.

2. **Open the solution**  
   Open the file `Zoo.sln` using Visual Studio Community.

3. **Add your model paths**  
   Update file paths in the code to match the model locations on your PC.

4. **Include libraries in your project**  
   Add the necessary libraries in your project's properties.

5. **Build and run**  
   Click the `Build` button and then `Start` to launch the virtual zoo.

> 🔔 *No need to move or modify any files. The project is configured to run directly.*

## 🏗️ Structure & Creation

Developed with:

- **Visual Studio Community**
- **C++**
- **OpenGL Graphics API**

Organized into multiple `.h` and `.cpp` files managing:

- Camera
- Libraries
- Source files
- Shaders
- Models

Program operations include:

- Creating a window and initializing OpenGL context
- Loading 3D models using Assimp and textures with stb_image
- Configuring shaders
- Rendering the 3D scene
- Playing sounds using OpenAL when near animals
